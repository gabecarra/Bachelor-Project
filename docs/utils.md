# utils


# utils.graph_parser

Parses a given set of JSON OpenPose structured data in a cleaner and
more easy-to-use JSON structured data. Can be used as it its, or by
passing the path to the JSON files in command line. If a path is not
given,it will assume that the data folder is in the same path as the
script.

## generate_dataset
```python
generate_dataset(path)
```
Given a path to a folder containing JSON files generated by
OpenPose, parse the files and generate a set of graphs based on the
dataset given, and save them as JSON in `path` + '/out/'

`str path`: path containing data generated by OpenPose

# utils.category_filter

Retrieves a set of filenames associated to a given category

## parse_category
```python
parse_category(cat_name: str, path='dataset_info/dataset_info.mat') -> list
```

Given a category and a path, parses the elements inside a .mat file,
in order to retrieve all the image file names that are within the
given category

`cat_name`: category of a given activity

`path`: path to the .mat file

`:return`: list of file names to be retrieved


# utils.edges_ref

Contains all the OpenPose edge references for face, hands and pose

## get_edges
```python
get_edges(node_type: str) -> list or None
```

Given a node type (pose, face, hand), returns the given edge set

`node_type`: the type of nodes needed

`:return`: list of edges, otherwise None


# utils.image_info

Fetches the resolution values from a set of images, and save the info as
txt files


## get_resolution
```python
get_resolution(path_name: str) -> str
```

Given a path of a txt generated by generate_image_info, returns its
content

`path_name`: path of the txt file

`path_name`: str

`:return`: resolution of an image specified by path_name


## generate_image_info
```python
generate_image_info(path: str)
```

Given a path, creates a folder for the output, if it doesn't exists,
and saves on the output folder for each image a txt containing its
resolution

`path`: path of the images

# utils.networkx_converter

Converts a JSON structured set of graphs, into an array of networkx
graphs

## get_nx_graphs
```python
get_nx_graphs(path: str, node_types: list, normalize: bool = False) -> list
```

Given a file path name, and the types of graph nodes, returns a list
of networkx graphs containing a graph for each person in the given
file/image.

`normalize`: if normalize is given, divides the (x,y)
values from the graph by their resolution in order to normalize
their values between 0 and 1

`path`: path name of a given file

`node_types`: list of node types. Can be one or more
of `'face'`, `'pose'`, `'handl'`, `'handr'`

`:return`: list containing a graph for each person in the file
