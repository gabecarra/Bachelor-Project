# src
This file contains the main implementation of the pipeline 
## src.pipeline

### parse_data
  ```python
  def parse_data(args: list):
  ```
  Parses the data passed as argument, and, depending on the arguments, applies OpenPose recognition to hands, face and body, and returns a set of JSON structured graphs

  `args`: list of arguments represented as a string
# utils
This file contains a series of utilities such as conversion and parsing of data
## utils.networkx_converter

### get_nx_graphs

```python
def get_nx_graphs(path: str, node_types: list, normalize: bool = False) -> list:
```
Given a file path name, and the types of graph nodes, returns a list of networkx graphs containing a graph for each person in the given file/image.

`normalize`: if normalize is given, divides the (x,y) values from the graph by their resolution in order to normalize their values between 0 and 1

`path`: path name of a given file

`node_types`: list of node types. Can be one or more of ->['face', 'pose', 'handl', 'handr']

@return `list`: list containing a graph for each person in the file

## utils.image_info

### get_resolution

```python
def get_resolution(path_name: str, file_name: str) -> list:
```
Given a path of a txt generated by generate_image_info, and the name of the file, returns a list containing the resolution of that file

`path_name`: path of the txt file

`file_name`: name of the given txt file

@return `str`: resolution of an image specified by path_name

### generate_image_info

```python
def generate_image_info(path: str):
``` 
  Given a path containing images, creates txt containing the name and resolution of each image in the given path
  
  `path`: path of the images
    
## utils.graph_parser

```python
def openpose_to_json(path: str):
```
Given a path to a folder containing JSON files generated by OpenPose, parse the files and generate a set of graphs based on the data set given, and save them as JSON in '../out/'

`path`: path containing data generated by OpenPose
  
## utils.category_filter

```python
def parse_category(cat_name: str, path=PATH) -> list:
```
Given a category and a path, parses the elements inside a .mat file, in order to retrieve all the image file names that are within the given category for the MPII Human Pose dataset

`cat_name`: category of a given activity

`path`: path to the .mat file

@return `list`: list of file names to be retrieved
