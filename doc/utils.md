# utils.graph_parser

Parses a given set of JSON OpenPose structured data in a cleaner and more easy-to-use JSON structured data


## parse_edges

```python
parse_edges(graph: dict, del_nodes: list, index: int, node_type: str)
```

Given a graph, a list of nodes to be deleted and the type of nodes(pose, hand or face), takes the edge set specified by node_type, removes the edges specified in del_nodes list, and return the resulting set of edges.

:param graph: Graph represented as a dict, containing only nodes

:param list del_nodes: Nodes to be deleted

:param int index: Index of the current person

:param str node_type: Type of nodes needed ('pose', 'hand' or 'face'). Default: 'pose'

:return list: List containing only the edges not specified in del_nodes


## parse_nodes

```python
parse_nodes(graph: dict, keypoints: list, index: int, k_type: str)
```

Given a graph represented as a dictionary, keypoints taken from a JSON, the index of the given graph, the type of keypoints(pose,handl, handr, face), parse the keypoints by creating nodes with the following attributes: {x, y, confidence}. Appends each node to the given graph.

:param dict graph: Graph represented as a dictionary

:param list keypoints: List of keypoints taken from OpenPose JSON

:param int index: Counter that represents the id of the current person keypoints being parsed

:param str k_type: Type of the given keypoints. Can be one of: 'pose', 'handl', 'handr' or 'face'

:return list: List of indexes of nodes for which no information was obtained by OpenPose


## find_node

```python
find_node(node_list: list, node_id: int)
```

Given a list of nodes and the id of a node, returns the given node if it exists, otherwise None

:param list node_list: List of nodes

:param int node_id: The id of a node

:return dict or None: The node with the given id, if it is found, otherwise None


## find_index

```python
find_index(node_list: list, node_id: int)
```

Given a list of nodes, and the id of a node, returns the position of the given node inside the list if it exists, otherwise None

:param list node_list: List of nodes

:param int node_id: The id of a node

:return int: Position of the node with the given id in the list, otherwise None


## generate_dataset

```python
generate_dataset(path)
```

Given a path to a folder containing JSON files generated by OpenPose, parse the files and generate a set of graphs based on the data set given, and save them as JSON in '../out/'

:param str path: path containing data generated by OpenPose


# utils.category_filter

Retrieves a set of filenames associated to a given category


## parse_category

```python
parse_category(cat_name: str, path='../mpii_human_pose/dataset.mat')
```

Given a category and a path, parses the elements inside a .mat file, in order to retrieve all the image file names that are within the given category

:param str cat_name: category of a given activity

:param str path: path to the .mat file

:return list: list of file names to be retrieved


# utils.edges_ref

Contains all the OpenPose edge references for face, hands and pose


## get_edges

```python
get_edges(node_type: str)
```

Given a node type (pose, face, hand), returns the given edge set

:param str node_type: the type of nodes needed

:return list or None: list of edges, otherwise None


# utils.image_info

Fetches the resolution values from a set of images, and save the info as txt files


## get_resolution

```python
get_resolution(path_name: str)
```

Given a path of a txt generated by generate_image_info, returns its content

:param path_name: path of the txt file

:type path_name: str

:return: resolution of an image specified by path_name

:rtype: str


## generate_image_info

```python
generate_image_info(path: str)
```

Given a path, creates a folder for the output, if it doesn't exists, and saves on the output folder for each image a txt containing its resolution

:param path: path of the images

:type path: str


# utils.networkx_converter

Converts a JSON structured set of graphs, into an array of networkx graphs


## get_nx_graph

```python
get_nx_graph(path: str, node_type: str = 'pose')
```

Given a file path name, and the type of graph nodes, returns a list of networkx graphs

:param str path: path name of a given file

:param str node_type: type of graph nodes wanted. Can be one of: 'pose', 'handl', 'handr', 'face'

:return list or None: list containing a graph for each person in the file
